## Software Test Automation - Amazon

## Project Description -

#### This project automates the manual testing process by validating various test cases such as login functionality of [Amazon](https://amazon.com) search input functionality and so on. The project begins with first preparing the test cases with their expected functionalities and then the test cases are converted to test scripts with the help of [Katalon Studio Web Recorder and Playback](https://katalon.com/). The same test cases are then run against different data formats such as csv or xls to perform data-driven testing. For the build delivery Katalon Studio is integrated with Git and Jenkins. For testing cross-browser interoperability of the test cases Katalon TestCloud is used. And finally, test report is generated.
